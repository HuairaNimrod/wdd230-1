                Hick's Law which is named after British psychologist William Edmund Hick is the idea that a person can increase the number of decisions he can make when it comes to a variety of choices that come along the way. 
                I chose the website of a well-known shipping company called Amazon, because it is the home to where many products are avaliable online for shipping. There are also products that don't require delivery that can be used on a mobile or desktop device.
                This website and many others follow Hick's Law because they provide the user with many different things to do and options to choose from.

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

            <p>
                The Rule of Thirds is when a picture is divided into 9 different rectangular blocks: 3 by 3 each. Those blocks focus on different parts of the pictures such as people or animals in self portraits or the sky, trees, and other forms of nature in landscape portraits.
                It can apply to websites by demonstrating where pictures, borders, and the text boxes are located on those websites. I picked the official website for the Franklin Institute because
                there are not only of those attributes on different parts of their website, but it also shows that there are different layout boxes in those as well.

            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <p></p>

            <p>
                Whitespace and clean design is where there is empty space in a majority of a picture or website. It is unique because it makes it easier to understand and see the bigger picture of what is being displayed or advertised.
                I chose the website for a well-known file sharing company called Dropbox, because there is not only plenty of whitespace in every part of their website, but there is also whitespace in the portions where people can share
                any kind of their files to other people. This makes it easier for people to see what is being shared and who they are sharing it with.
